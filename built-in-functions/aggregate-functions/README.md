# Aggregate Functions

The following functions (also called aggregate functions) can be used with the [GROUP BY](/sql-statements-structure/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/group-by/) clause:

- [Stored Aggregate Functions](/programming-customizing-mariadb/stored-routines/stored-functions/stored-aggregate-functions/) — Custom aggregate functions.
- [AVG](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/avg/) — Returns the average value.
- [BIT_AND](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/bit_and/) — Bitwise AND.
- [BIT_OR](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/bit_or/) — Bitwise OR.
- [BIT_XOR](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/bit_xor/) — Bitwise XOR.
- [COUNT](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/count/) — Returns count of non-null values.
- [COUNT DISTINCT](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/count-distinct/) — Returns count of number of different non-NULL values.
- [GROUP_CONCAT](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/group_concat/) — Returns string with concatenated values from a group.
- [JSON_ARRAYAGG](/built-in-functions/special-functions/json-functions/json_arrayagg/) — Returns a JSON array containing an element for each value in a given set of JSON or SQL values.
- [JSON_OBJECTAGG](/built-in-functions/special-functions/json-functions/json_objectagg/) — Returns a JSON object containing key-value pairs.
- [MAX](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/max/) — Returns the maximum value.
- [MIN](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/min/) — Returns the minimum value.
- [STD](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/std/) — Population standard deviation.
- [STDDEV](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/stddev/) — Population standard deviation.
- [STDDEV_POP](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/stddev_pop/) — Returns the population standard deviation.
- [STDDEV_SAMP](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/stddev_samp/) — Standard deviation.
- [SUM](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/sum/) — Sum total.
- [VARIANCE](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/variance/) — Population standard variance.
- [VAR_POP](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/var_pop/) — Population standard variance.
- [VAR_SAMP](/built-in-functions/aggregate-functions/var_samp/) — Returns the sample variance.
