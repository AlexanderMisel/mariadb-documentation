# Bit Functions and Operators

Operators for comparison and setting of values, and related functions.

- [Operator Precedence](/sql-statements-structure/operators/operator-precedence/) — Precedence of SQL operators
- [&](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/bit-functions-and-operators/bitwise_and/) — Bitwise AND
- [<<](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/bit-functions-and-operators/shift-left/) — Left shift
- [>>](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/bit-functions-and-operators/shift-right/) — Shift right
- [BIT_COUNT](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/bit-functions-and-operators/bit_count/) — Returns the number of set bits
- [^](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/bit-functions-and-operators/bitwise-xor/) — Bitwise XOR
- [|](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/bit-functions-and-operators/bitwise-or/) — Bitwise OR
- [~](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/bit-functions-and-operators/bitwise-not/) — Bitwise NOT
- [Parentheses](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/bit-functions-and-operators/parentheses/) — Parentheses modify the precedence of other operators in an expression
- [TRUE FALSE](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/bit-functions-and-operators/true-false/) — TRUE and FALSE evaluate to 1 and 0
