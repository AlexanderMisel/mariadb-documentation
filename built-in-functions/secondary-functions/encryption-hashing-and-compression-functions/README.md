# Encryption, Hashing and Compression Functions

Encryption, hashing and compression functions, such as ENCRYPT, DECRYPT, COMPRESS,  PASSWORD etc.

- [AES_DECRYPT](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/aes_decrypt/) — Decryption data encrypted with AES_ENCRYPT
- [AES_ENCRYPT](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/aes_encrypt/) — Encrypts a string with the AES algorithm.
- [COMPRESS](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/compress/) — Returns a binary, compressed string.
- [DECODE](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/decode/) — Decrypts a string encoded with ENCODE(), or, in Oracle mode, matches expressions.
- [DES_DECRYPT](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/des_decrypt/) — Decrypts a string encrypted with DES_ENCRYPT().
- [DES_ENCRYPT](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/des_encrypt/) — Encrypts a string using the Triple-DES algorithm.
- [ENCODE](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/encode/) — Encrypts a string.
- [ENCRYPT](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/encrypt/) — Encrypts a string with Unix crypt().
- [MD5](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/md5/) — MD5 checksum.
- [OLD_PASSWORD](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/old_password/) — Pre MySQL 4.1 password implementation.
- [PASSWORD](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/password/) — Calculates a password string.
- [SHA1](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/sha1/) — Calculates an SHA-1 checksum.
- [SHA2](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/sha2/) — Calculates an SHA-2 checksum.
- [UNCOMPRESS](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/uncompress/) — Uncompresses string compressed with COMPRESS().
- [UNCOMPRESSED_LENGTH](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/uncompressed_length/) — Returns length of a string before being compressed with COMPRESS().
