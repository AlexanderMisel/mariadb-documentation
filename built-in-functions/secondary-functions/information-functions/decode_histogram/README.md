# DECODE_HISTOGRAM

##### MariaDB starting with [10.0.2](/kb/en/mariadb-1002-release-notes/)

DECODE_HISTOGRAM() was introduced in [MariaDB 10.0.2](/kb/en/mariadb-1002-release-notes/)

## Syntax

```sql
DECODE_HISTOGRAM(hist_type,histogram)
```

Note: Before [MariaDB 10.0.10](/kb/en/mariadb-10010-release-notes/) the arguments were reversed.

## Description

Returns a string of comma separated numeric values corresponding to a probability distribution represented by the histogram of type `hist_type` (`SINGLE_PREC_HB` or `DOUBLE_PREC_HB`). The `hist_type` and `histogram` would be commonly used from the [mysql.column_stats table](/kb/en/mysqlcolumn_stats-table/).

See [Histogram Based Statistics](/replication/optimization-and-tuning/query-optimizations/statistics-for-optimizing-queries/histogram-based-statistics/) for details.

## Examples

```sql
CREATE TABLE origin (
  i INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  v INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO origin(v) VALUES 
  (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(10),(20),
  (30),(40),(50),(60),(70),(80),
  (90),(100),(200),(400),(800);

SET histogram_size=10,histogram_type=SINGLE_PREC_HB;
