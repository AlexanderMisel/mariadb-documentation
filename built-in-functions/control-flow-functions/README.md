# Control Flow Functions

Built-In functions for assessing data to determine what results to return.

- [CASE OPERATOR](/built-in-functions/control-flow-functions/case-operator/) — Returns the result where value=compare_value or for the first condition that is true.
- [DECODE](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/decode/) — Decrypts a string encoded with ENCODE(), or, in Oracle mode, matches expressions.
- [DECODE_ORACLE](/built-in-functions/control-flow-functions/decode_oracle/) — Synonym for the Oracle mode version of DECODE().
- [IF Function](/built-in-functions/control-flow-functions/if-function/) — If expr1 is TRUE, returns expr2; otherwise it returns expr3.
- [IFNULL](/built-in-functions/control-flow-functions/ifnull/) — Check whether an expression is NULL.
- [NULLIF](/built-in-functions/control-flow-functions/nullif/) — Returns NULL if expr1 = expr2.
- [NVL](/built-in-functions/control-flow-functions/nvl/) — Synonym for IFNULL.
- [NVL2](/built-in-functions/control-flow-functions/nvl2/) — Returns a value based on whether a specified expression is NULL or not.
