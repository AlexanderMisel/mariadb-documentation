# TokuDB Resources

TokuDB has been deprecated by its upstream maintainer. It is disabled from [MariaDB 10.5](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-105/) and has been been removed in [MariaDB 10.6](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-106/) - [MDEV-19780](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19780). We recommend [MyRocks](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/myrocks) as a long-term migration path.

This page contains links to various online resources for [TokuDB](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/tokudb).

## Website

Tokutek was the primary developer of TokuDB before being acquired by Percona. [Their website](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-tokudb).

## Mailing Lists

There were two TokuDB specific mailing lists run by Tokutek:

- [tokudb-user](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tokudb-user) - a mailing list for users of TokuDB
- [tokudb-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tokudb-dev) - a mailing list TokuDB contributors

These were discontinued and redirected to [Percona's MySQL and MariaDB forum](https://forums.percona.com/categories/mysql-mariadb).
