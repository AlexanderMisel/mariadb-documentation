# Table Discovery

In MariaDB it is not always necessary to run an explicit `CREATE TABLE` statement for a table to appear. Sometimes a table may already exist in the storage engine, but the server does not know about it, because there is no `.frm` file for this table. This can happen for various reasons; for example, for a cluster engine the table might have been created in the cluster by another MariaDB server node. Or for the engine that supports table shipping a table file might have been simply copied into the MariaDB data directory. But no matter what the reason is, there is a mechanism for an engine to tell the server that the table exists. This mechanism is called <strong>table discovery</strong> and if an engine wants the server to discover its tables, the engine should support the table discovery API.

There are two different kinds of table discovery — a fully automatic discovery and a user-assisted one. In the former, the engine can automatically discover the table whenever an SQL statement needs it. In MariaDB, the [Archive](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/archive/) and [Sequence](/kb/en/sequence/) engines support this kind of discovery. For example, one can copy a `t1.ARZ` file into the database directory and immediately start using it — the corresponding `.frm` file will be created automatically. Or one can select from say, the `seq_1_to_10` table without any explicit `CREATE TABLE` statement.

In the latter, user-assisted, discovery the engine does not have enough information to discover the table all on its own. But it can discover the table structure if the user provides certain additional information. In this case, an explicit `CREATE TABLE` statement is still necessary, but it should contain no table structure — only the table name and the table attributes. In MariaDB, the [FederatedX](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/federatedx-storage-engine/) storage engine supports this. When creating a table, one only needs to specify the `CONNECTION` attribute and the table structure — fields and indexes — will be provided automatically by the engine.

### Automatic Discovery

As far as automatic table discovery is concerned, the tables, from the server point of view, may appear, disappear, or change structure anytime. Thus the server needs to be able to ask whether a given table exists and what its structure is. It needs to be notified when a table structure changes outside of the server. And it needs to be able to get a list of all (unknown to the server) tables, for statements like `SHOW TABLES`. The server does all that by invoking specific methods of the `handlerton`:

```sql
const char **tablefile_extensions;
int (*discover_table_names)(handlerton *hton, LEX_STRING *db, MY_DIR *dir,
                            discovered_list *result);
int (*discover_table_existence)(handlerton *hton, const char *db,
                                const char *table_name);
int (*discover_table)(handlerton *hton, THD* thd, TABLE_SHARE *share);
```

#### handlerton::tablefile_extensions

Engines that store tables in separate files (one table might occupy many files with different extensions, but having the same base file name) should store the list of possible extensions in the <strong>tablefile_extensions</strong> member of the `handlerton` (earlier this list was returned by the `handler::bas_ext()` method). This will significantly simplify the discovery implementation for these engines, as you will see below.

#### handlerton::discover_table_names()

When a user asks for a list of tables in a specific database — for example, by using `SHOW TABLES` or by selecting from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` — the server invokes <strong>discover_table_names()</strong> method of the `handlerton`. For convenience this method, besides the database name in question, gets the list of all files in this database directory, so that the engine can look for table files without doing any filesystem i/o. All discovered tables should be added to the `result` collector object. It is defined as

```sql
class discovered_list
{
  public:
  bool add_table(const char *tname, size_t tlen);
  bool add_file(const char *fname);
};
```

and the engine should call `result-&gt;add_table()` or `result-&gt;add_file()` for every discovered table (use `add_file()` if the name to add is in the MariaDB file name encoding, and `add_table()` if it's a true table name, as shown in `SHOW TABLES`).

If the engine is file-based, that is, it has non-empty list in the `tablefile_extensions`, this method is optional. For any file-based engine that does not implement `discover_table_names()`, MariaDB will automatically discover the list of all tables of this engine, by looking for files with the extension `tablefile_extensions[0]`.

#### handlerton::discover_table_existence()

In some rare cases MariaDB needs to know whether a given table exists, but does not particularly care about this table structure (for example, when executing a `DROP TABLE` statement). In these cases, the server uses the <strong>discover_table_existence()</strong> method to find out whether a table with the given name exists in the engine.

This method is optional. For the engine that does not implement it, MariaDB will look for files with the `tablefile_extensions[0]`, if possible. But if the engine is not file-based, MariaDB will use the `discover_table()` method to perform a full table discovery. While this will allow determining correctly whether a table exists, a full discovery is usually slower than the simple existence check. In other words, engines that are not file-based might want to support `discover_table_existence()` method as a useful optimization.

#### handlerton::discover_table()

This is the main method of table discovery, the heart of it. The server invokes it when it wants to use the table. The <strong>discover_table()</strong> method gets the `TABLE_SHARE` structure, which is not completely initialized — only the table and the database name (and a path to the table file) are filled in. It should initialize this `TABLE_SHARE` with the desired table structure.

MariaDB provides convenient and easy to use helpers that allow the engine to initialize the `TABLE_SHARE` with minimal efforts. They are the `TABLE_SHARE` methods `init_from_binary_frm_image()` and `init_from_sql_statement_string()`.

#### TABLE_SHARE::init_from_binary_frm_image()

This method is used by engines that use "frm shipping" — such as [Archive](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/archive/) or NDB Cluster in MySQL. An frm shipping engine reads the frm file for a given table, exactly as it was generated by the server, and stores it internally. Later it can discover the table structure by using this very frm image. In this sense, a separate frm file in the database directory becomes redundant, because a copy of it is stored in the engine.

#### TABLE_SHARE::init_from_sql_statement_string()

This method allows initializing the `TABLE_SHARE` using a conventional SQL `CREATE TABLE` syntax.

#### TABLE_SHARE::read_frm_image()

Engines that use frm shipping need to get the frm image corresponding to a particular table (typically in the `handler::create()` method). They do it via the <strong>read_frm_image()</strong> method. It returns an allocated buffer with the binary frm image, that the engine can use the way it needs.

#### TABLE_SHARE::free_frm_image()

The frm image that was returned by `read_frm_image()` must be freed with the <strong>free_frm_image()</strong>.

#### HA_ERR_TABLE_DEF_CHANGED

One of the consequences of automatic discovery is that the table definition might change when the server doesn't expect it to. Between two `SELECT` queries, for example. If this happens, if the engine detects that the server is using an outdated version of the table definition, it should return a <strong>HA_ERR_TABLE_DEF_CHANGED</strong> handler error. Depending on when in the query processing this error has happened, MariaDB will either re-discover the table and execute the query with the correct table structure, or abort the query and return an error message to the user.

#### TABLE_SHARE::tabledef_version

The previous paragraph doesn't cover one important question — how can the engine know that the server uses an outdated table definition? The answer is — by checking the <strong>tabledef_version</strong>, the table definition version. Every table gets a unique `tabledef_version` value. Normally it is generated automatically when a table is created. When a table is discovered the engine can force it to have a specific `tabledef_version` value (simply by setting it in the `TABLE_SHARE` before calling the `init_from_binary_frm_image()` or `init_from_sql_statement_string()` methods).

Now the engine can compare the table definition version that the server is using (from any handler method it can be accessed as `this-&gt;table-&gt;s-&gt;tabledef_version`) with the version of the actual table definition. If they differ — it is `HA_ERR_TABLE_DEF_CHANGED`.

### Assisted discovery

Assisted discovery is a lot simpler from the server point of view, a lot more controlled. The table cannot appear or disappear at will, one still needs explicit DDL statements to manipulate it. There is only one new handlerton method that the server uses to discover the table structure when a user has issued an explicit `CREATE TABLE` statement without declaring any columns or indexes.

```sql
int (*discover_table_structure)(handlerton *hton, THD* thd,
                               TABLE_SHARE *share, HA_CREATE_INFO *info);
```

The assisted discovery API is pretty much independent from the automatic discovery API. An engine can implement either of them or both (or none); there is no requirement to support automatic discovery if only assisted discovery is needed.

#### handlerton::discover_table_structure()

Much like the `discover_table()` method, the <strong>discover_table_structure()</strong> handlerton method gets a partially initialized `TABLE_SHARE` with the table name, database name, and a path to table files filled in, but without a table structure. Unlike `discover_table()`, here the `TABLE_SHARE` has all the [engine-defined table attributes](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/storage-engines-storage-engine-development/engine-defined-new-tablefieldindex-attributes/) in the the `TABLE_SHARE::option_struct` structure. Based on the values of these attributes the `discover_table_structure()` method should initialize the `TABLE_SHARE` with the desired set of fields and keys. It can use `TABLE_SHARE` helper methods `init_from_binary_frm_image()` and `init_from_sql_statement_string()` for that.

### The role of `.frm` files

Before table discovery was introduced, MariaDB used `.frm` files to store the table definition. But now the engine can store the table definition (if the engine supports automatic discovery, of course), and `.frm` files become redundant. Still, the server <em>can</em> use `.frm` files for such an engine — but they are no longer the only source of the table definition. Now `.frm` files are merely a <em>cache</em> of the table definition, while the original authoritative table definition is stored in the engine. Like any cache, its purpose is to reduce discovery attempts for a table. The engine decides whether it makes sense to cache table definition in the `.frm` file or not (see the second argument for the `TABLE_SHARE::init_from_binary_frm_image()`). For example, the [Archive](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/archive/) engine uses `.frm` cache, while the [Sequence](/kb/en/sequence/) engine does not. In other words, MariaDB creates `.frm` files for [Archive](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/archive/) tables, but not for [Sequence](/kb/en/sequence/) tables.

The cache is completely transparent for a user; MariaDB makes sure that it always stores the actual table definition and invalidates the `.frm` file automatically when it becomes out of date. This can happen, for example, if a user copies a new [Archive](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/archive/) table into the datadir and forgets to delete the `.frm` file of the old table with the same name.
