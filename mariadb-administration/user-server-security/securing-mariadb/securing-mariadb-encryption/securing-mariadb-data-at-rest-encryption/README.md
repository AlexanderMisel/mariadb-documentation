# Data-at-Rest Encryption

MariaDB supports the use of data-at-rest encryption for tables and tablespaces from [MariaDB 10.1](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-101/).  For a minor performance overhead of 3-5%, this makes it almost impossible for someone with access to the host system or who steals a hard drive to read the original data.
