# How to match API version for php5_mysql and mariadb client?

Hello!
I have recent php5 and php5_mysql installed from Ubuntu repos. When i'm running scripts connecting to DB i get "mysql_connect(): Headers and client library minor version mismatch. Headers:50149 Library:50203".

I suppose i could suppress errors but it isn't my way. But what is the correct way to fix it?
