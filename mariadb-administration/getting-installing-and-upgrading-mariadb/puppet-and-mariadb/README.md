# Puppet and MariaDB

If you are using configuration management like [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/), you will be pleased to note that there are multiple Puppet modules that allow you to use MariaDB.

1 [Kris Buytaert puppet-mariadb](https://github.com/KrisBuytaert/puppet-mariadb) is a module that allows installation via APT or YUM repositories, but does not perform configuration as that comes via any regular MySQL module.
2 [Rudy Gevaert puppet-mysql](https://github.com/rgevaert/puppet-mysql) is a module that configures MySQL, MariaDB and Percona Server.

Let us know which one works best for you!
