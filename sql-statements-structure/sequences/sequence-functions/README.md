Functions that can be used on SEQUENCEs

- [LASTVAL](/sql-statements-structure/sequences/sequence-functions/lastval/) — Synonym for PREVIOUS VALUE for sequence_name.
- [NEXT VALUE for sequence_name](/sql-statements-structure/sequences/sequence-functions/next-value-for-sequence_name/) — Generate next value for a SEQUENCE. Same as NEXTVAL().
- [NEXTVAL](/sql-statements-structure/sequences/sequence-functions/nextval/) — Synonym for NEXT VALUE for sequence_name.
- [PREVIOUS VALUE FOR sequence_name](/sql-statements-structure/sequences/sequence-functions/previous-value-for-sequence_name/) — Get last value generated from a SEQUENCE. Same as LASTVAL().
- [SETVAL()](/sql-statements-structure/sequences/sequence-functions/setval/) — Set the next value to be returned from a SEQUENCE.
