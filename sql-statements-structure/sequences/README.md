# Sequences

##### MariaDB starting with [10.3](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-103/)

CREATE SEQUENCE was introduced in [MariaDB 10.3](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-103/).

A sequence is an object that generates a sequence of numeric values, as specified by the [CREATE SEQUENCE](/sql-statements-structure/sequences/create-sequence) statement.  Sequences are an alternative to [AUTO_INCREMENT](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/data-types/auto_increment) when you want more control over how sequence numbers are generated.

Since a `SEQUENCE` caches values, it can sometimes be faster. Also, you can access the last value generated by all used sequences; it's not subjected to limitations of [LAST_INSERT_ID( )](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/last_insert_id).

This section is about sequence objects. For details about the storage engine, see [Sequence Storage Engine](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/sequence-storage-engine).
