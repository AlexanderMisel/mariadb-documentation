# Subqueries and JOINs

A [subquery](/sql-statements-structure/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/joins-subqueries/subqueries/) can quite often, but not in all cases, be rewritten as a [JOIN](/kb/en/join/).

## Rewriting Subqueries as JOINS

A subquery using `IN` can be rewritten with the `DISTINCT` keyword, for example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1 IN (SELECT col1 FROM table2);
```

can be rewritten as:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1, table2 WHERE table1.col1=table2.col1;
```

`NOT IN` or `NOT EXISTS` queries can also be rewritten. For example, these two queries returns the same result:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1 NOT IN (SELECT col1 FROM table2);
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT col1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.col1=table2.col1);
```

and both can be rewritten as:

```sql
SELECT table1.* FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id WHERE table2.id IS NULL;
```

Subqueries that can be rewritten as a LEFT JOIN are sometimes more efficient.

## Using Subqueries instead of JOINS

There are some scenarios, though, which call for subqueries rather than joins:

- When you want duplicates, but not false duplicates. Suppose `Table_1`
  has three rows <span>—</span> {`1`,`1`,`2`}
  <span>—</span> and `Table_2` has two rows
  <span>—</span> {`1`,`2`,`2`}. If you need to list the rows
  in `Table_1` which are also in `Table_2`, only this
  subquery-based `SELECT` statement will give the right answer
  (`1`,`1`,`2`):

```sql
SELECT Table_1.column_1 
FROM   Table_1 
WHERE  Table_1.column_1 IN 
  (SELECT Table_2.column_1 
    FROM   Table_2);
```

- This SQL statement won't work:

```sql
SELECT Table_1.column_1 
FROM   Table_1,Table_2 
WHERE  Table_1.column_1 = Table_2.column_1;
```

- because the result will be {`1`,`1`,`2`,`2`}
  <span>—</span> and the duplication of 2 is an error.  This SQL
  statement won't work either:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Table_1.column_1 
FROM   Table_1,Table_2 
WHERE  Table_1.column_1 = Table_2.column_1;
```

- because the result will be {`1`,`2`} <span>—</span> and
  the removal of the duplicated 1 is an error too.

- When the outermost statement is not a query. The SQL statement:

```sql
UPDATE Table_1 SET column_1 = (SELECT column_1 FROM Table_2);
```

- can't be expressed using a join unless some rare SQL3 features are used.

- When the join is over an expression. The SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Table_1 
WHERE column_1 + 5 =
  (SELECT MAX(column_1) FROM Table_2);
```

- is hard to express with a join. In fact, the only way we can think of is
  this SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT Table_1.*
FROM   Table_1, 
      (SELECT MAX(column_1) AS max_column_1 FROM Table_2) AS Table_2
WHERE  Table_1.column_1 + 5 = Table_2.max_column_1;
```

- which still involves a parenthesized query, so nothing is gained from the
  transformation.

- When you want to see the exception. For example, suppose the question is:
  what books are longer than Das Kapital? These two queries are effectively
  almost the same:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Bookcolumn_1.*                     
FROM   Books AS Bookcolumn_1 JOIN Books AS Bookcolumn_2 USING(page_count) 
WHERE  title = 'Das Kapital';

SELECT DISTINCT Bookcolumn_1.* 
FROM   Books AS Bookcolumn_1 
WHERE  Bookcolumn_1.page_count > 
  (SELECT DISTINCT page_count 
  FROM   Books AS Bookcolumn_2 
  WHERE  title = 'Das Kapital');
```

- The difference is between these two SQL statements is, if there are two
  editions of <em>Das Kapital</em> (with different page counts), then the self-join
  example will return the books which are  longer than the shortest edition
  of <em>Das Kapital</em>. That might be the wrong answer, since the original
  question didn't ask for "... longer than `ANY` book named <em>Das Kapital</em>"
  (it seems to contain a false assumption that there's only one edition).
