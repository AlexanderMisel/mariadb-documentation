# More Advanced Joins

This article is a follow up to the
[Introduction to JOINs](/kb/en/introduction-to-joins/) page. If you're just getting
started with JOINs, go through that page first and then come back here.

## The Employee Database

Let us begin by using an example employee database of a fairly small family
business, which does not anticipate expanding in the future.

First, we create the table that will hold all of the employees and their
contact information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `Employees` (
  `ID` TINYINT(3) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `First_Name` VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
  `Last_Name` VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
  `Position` VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
  `Home_Address` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  `Home_Phone` VARCHAR(12) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`ID`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM;
```

Next, we add a few employees to the table:

```sql
INSERT INTO `Employees` (`First_Name`, `Last_Name`, `Position`, `Home_Address`, `Home_Phone`)
  VALUES
  ('Mustapha', 'Mond', 'Chief Executive Officer', '692 Promiscuous Plaza', '326-555-3492'),
  ('Henry', 'Foster', 'Store Manager', '314 Savage Circle', '326-555-3847'),
  ('Bernard', 'Marx', 'Cashier', '1240 Ambient Avenue', '326-555-8456'),
  ('Lenina', 'Crowne', 'Cashier', '281 Bumblepuppy Boulevard', '328-555-2349'),
  ('Fanny', 'Crowne', 'Restocker', '1023 Bokanovsky Lane', '326-555-6329'),
  ('Helmholtz', 'Watson', 'Janitor', '944 Soma Court', '329-555-2478'); 
```

Now, we create a second table, containing the hours which each employee clocked
in and out during the week:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `Hours` (
  `ID` TINYINT(3) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  `Clock_In` DATETIME NOT NULL,
  `Clock_Out` DATETIME NOT NULL
) ENGINE=MyISAM;
```

Finally, although it is a lot of information, we add a full week of hours for
each of the employees into the second table that we created:

```sql
INSERT INTO `Hours`
  VALUES
  ('1', '2005-08-08 07:00:42', '2005-08-08 17:01:36'),
  ('1', '2005-08-09 07:01:34', '2005-08-09 17:10:11'),
  ('1', '2005-08-10 06:59:56', '2005-08-10 17:09:29'),
  ('1', '2005-08-11 07:00:17', '2005-08-11 17:00:47'),
  ('1', '2005-08-12 07:02:29', '2005-08-12 16:59:12'),
  ('2', '2005-08-08 07:00:25', '2005-08-08 17:03:13'),
  ('2', '2005-08-09 07:00:57', '2005-08-09 17:05:09'),
  ('2', '2005-08-10 06:58:43', '2005-08-10 16:58:24'),
  ('2', '2005-08-11 07:01:58', '2005-08-11 17:00:45'),
  ('2', '2005-08-12 07:02:12', '2005-08-12 16:58:57'),
  ('3', '2005-08-08 07:00:12', '2005-08-08 17:01:32'),
  ('3', '2005-08-09 07:01:10', '2005-08-09 17:00:26'),
  ('3', '2005-08-10 06:59:53', '2005-08-10 17:02:53'),
  ('3', '2005-08-11 07:01:15', '2005-08-11 17:04:23'),
  ('3', '2005-08-12 07:00:51', '2005-08-12 16:57:52'),
  ('4', '2005-08-08 06:54:37', '2005-08-08 17:01:23'),
  ('4', '2005-08-09 06:58:23', '2005-08-09 17:00:54'),
  ('4', '2005-08-10 06:59:14', '2005-08-10 17:00:12'),
  ('4', '2005-08-11 07:00:49', '2005-08-11 17:00:34'),
  ('4', '2005-08-12 07:01:09', '2005-08-12 16:58:29'),
  ('5', '2005-08-08 07:00:04', '2005-08-08 17:01:43'),
  ('5', '2005-08-09 07:02:12', '2005-08-09 17:02:13'),
  ('5', '2005-08-10 06:59:39', '2005-08-10 17:03:37'),
  ('5', '2005-08-11 07:01:26', '2005-08-11 17:00:03'),
  ('5', '2005-08-12 07:02:15', '2005-08-12 16:59:02'),
  ('6', '2005-08-08 07:00:12', '2005-08-08 17:01:02'),
  ('6', '2005-08-09 07:03:44', '2005-08-09 17:00:00'),
  ('6', '2005-08-10 06:54:19', '2005-08-10 17:03:31'),
  ('6', '2005-08-11 07:00:05', '2005-08-11 17:02:57'),
  ('6', '2005-08-12 07:02:07', '2005-08-12 16:58:23');
```

## Working with the Employee Database

Now that we have a cleanly structured database to work with, let us begin this
tutorial by stepping up one notch from the last tutorial and filtering our
information a little.

### Filtering by Name

Earlier in the week, an anonymous employee reported that Helmholtz came into
work almost four minutes late; to verify this, we will begin our investigation
by filtering out employees whose first names are "Helmholtz":

```sql
SELECT
  `Employees`.`First_Name`,
  `Employees`.`Last_Name`,
  `Hours`.`Clock_In`,
  `Hours`.`Clock_Out`
FROM `Employees`
INNER JOIN `Hours` ON `Employees`.`ID` = `Hours`.`ID`
WHERE `Employees`.`First_Name` = 'Helmholtz';
```

The result:

```sql
+------------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+
| First_Name | Last_Name | Clock_In            | Clock_Out           |
+------------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+
| Helmholtz  | Watson    | 2005-08-08 07:00:12 | 2005-08-08 17:01:02 |
| Helmholtz  | Watson    | 2005-08-09 07:03:44 | 2005-08-09 17:00:00 |
| Helmholtz  | Watson    | 2005-08-10 06:54:19 | 2005-08-10 17:03:31 |
| Helmholtz  | Watson    | 2005-08-11 07:00:05 | 2005-08-11 17:02:57 |
| Helmholtz  | Watson    | 2005-08-12 07:02:07 | 2005-08-12 16:58:23 |
+------------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

This is obviously more information than we care to trudge through, considering
we only care about when he arrived past 7:00:59 on any given day within this
week; thus, we need to add a couple more conditions to our WHERE clause.

### Filtering by Name, Date and Time

In the following example, we will filter out all of the times which Helmholtz
clocked in that were before 7:01:00 and during the work week that lasted from
the 8th to the 12th of August:

```sql
SELECT
  `Employees`.`First_Name`,
  `Employees`.`Last_Name`,
  `Hours`.`Clock_In`,
  `Hours`.`Clock_Out`
FROM `Employees`
INNER JOIN `Hours` ON `Employees`.`ID` = `Hours`.`ID`
WHERE `Employees`.`First_Name` = 'Helmholtz'
AND DATE_FORMAT(`Hours`.`Clock_In`, '%Y-%m-%d') >= '2005-08-08'
AND DATE_FORMAT(`Hours`.`Clock_In`, '%Y-%m-%d') <= '2005-08-12'
AND DATE_FORMAT(`Hours`.`Clock_In`, '%H:%i:%S') > '07:00:59';
```

The result:

```sql
+------------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+
| First_Name | Last_Name | Clock_In            | Clock_Out           |
+------------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+
| Helmholtz  | Watson    | 2005-08-09 07:03:44 | 2005-08-09 17:00:00 |
| Helmholtz  | Watson    | 2005-08-12 07:02:07 | 2005-08-12 16:58:23 |
+------------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

We have now, by merely adding a few more conditions, eliminated all of the
irrelevant information; Helmholtz was late to work on the 9th and the 12th of
August.

### Displaying Total Work Hours per Day

Suppose you would like toâ€”based on the information stored in both of our
tables in the employee databaseâ€”develop a quick list of the total hours each
employee has worked for each day recorded; a simple way to estimate the time
each employee worked per day is exemplified below:

```sql
SELECT
  `Employees`.`ID`,
  `Employees`.`First_Name`,
  `Employees`.`Last_Name`,
  `Hours`.`Clock_In`,
  `Hours`.`Clock_Out`,
DATE_FORMAT(`Hours`.`Clock_Out`, '%T')-DATE_FORMAT(`Hours`.`Clock_In`, '%T') AS 'Total_Hours'
FROM `Employees` INNER JOIN `Hours` ON `Employees`.`ID` = `Hours`.`ID`;
```

The result (limited by 10):

```sql
+----+------------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+-------------+
| ID | First_Name | Last_Name | Clock_In            | Clock_Out           | Total_Hours |
+----+------------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+-------------+
|  1 | Mustapha   | Mond      | 2005-08-08 07:00:42 | 2005-08-08 17:01:36 |          10 |
|  1 | Mustapha   | Mond      | 2005-08-09 07:01:34 | 2005-08-09 17:10:11 |          10 |
|  1 | Mustapha   | Mond      | 2005-08-10 06:59:56 | 2005-08-10 17:09:29 |          11 |
|  1 | Mustapha   | Mond      | 2005-08-11 07:00:17 | 2005-08-11 17:00:47 |          10 |
|  1 | Mustapha   | Mond      | 2005-08-12 07:02:29 | 2005-08-12 16:59:12 |           9 |
|  2 | Henry      | Foster    | 2005-08-08 07:00:25 | 2005-08-08 17:03:13 |          10 |
|  2 | Henry      | Foster    | 2005-08-09 07:00:57 | 2005-08-09 17:05:09 |          10 |
|  2 | Henry      | Foster    | 2005-08-10 06:58:43 | 2005-08-10 16:58:24 |          10 |
|  2 | Henry      | Foster    | 2005-08-11 07:01:58 | 2005-08-11 17:00:45 |          10 |
|  2 | Henry      | Foster    | 2005-08-12 07:02:12 | 2005-08-12 16:58:57 |           9 |
+----+------------+-----------+---------------------+---------------------+-------------+
10 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
