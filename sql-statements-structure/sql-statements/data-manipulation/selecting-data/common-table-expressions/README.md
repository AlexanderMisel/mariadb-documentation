- [WITH](/kb/en/library/documentation/sql-statements-structure/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/common-table-expressions/with/) — Allows reference to subqueries as temporary tables within queries.
- [Non-Recursive Common Table Expressions Overview](/kb/en/library/documentation/sql-statements-structure/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/common-table-expressions/non-recursive-common-table-expressions-overview/) — Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are essentially Temporary Named Result Sets.
- [Recursive Common Table Expressions Overview](/kb/en/library/documentation/sql-statements-structure/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/common-table-expressions/recursive-common-table-expressions-overview/) — A recursive CTE will repeatedly execute subsets of the data until obtaining the complete results
