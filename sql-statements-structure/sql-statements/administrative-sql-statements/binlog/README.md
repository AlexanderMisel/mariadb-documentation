## Syntax

BINLOG 'str'

## Description

`BINLOG` is an internal-use statement. It is generated by the
[mariadb-binlog/mysqlbinlog](/clients-utilities/mysqlbinlog/) program as the printable representation of certain events
in [binary log](/mariadb-administration/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) files.  The <code class="highlight fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">'str'</code> value is a base 64-encoded
string the that server decodes to determine the data change indicated by the
corresponding event. This statement requires the [SUPER](/kb/en/grant/#super) privilege (&lt;= [MariaDB 10.5.1](/kb/en/mariadb-1051-release-notes/)) or the[BINLOG REPLAY](/kb/en/grant/#binlog-replay) privilege (&gt;= [MariaDB 10.5.2](/kb/en/mariadb-1052-release-notes/)).
