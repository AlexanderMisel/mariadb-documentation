# Information Schema INNODB_FT_DELETED Table

##### MariaDB starting with [10.0](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-100/)

The `INNODB_FT_DELETED` table was added in [MariaDB 10.0](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-100/) and MySQL 5.6

The [Information Schema](/kb/en/information_schema/) `INNODB_FT_DELETED` table contains rows that have been deleted from an InnoDB [fulltext index](/replication/optimization-and-tuning/optimization-and-indexes/full-text-indexes/). This information is then used to filter results on subsequent searches, removing the need to expensively reorganise the index each time a row is deleted.

The fulltext index is then only reorganized when an [OPTIMIZE TABLE](/replication/optimization-and-tuning/optimizing-tables/optimize-table/) statement is underway. The related [INNODB_FT_BEING_DELETED](/sql-statements-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-innodb-tables/information-schema-innodb_ft_being_deleted-table/) table contains rows being deleted while an `OPTIMIZE TABLE` is in the process of running.

The `SUPER` [privilege](/sql-statements-structure/sql-statements/account-management-sql-commands/grant/) is required to view the table, and it also requires the [innodb_ft_aux_table](/kb/en/innodb-system-variables/#innodb_ft_aux_table) system variable to be set.

It has the following column:

<table><tbody><tr><th>Column</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>DOC_ID</code></td><td>Document ID of the deleted row deleted. Either an underlying ID value, or a sequence value generated by InnoDB if no usable option exists.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_FT_DELETED;
+--------+
| DOC_ID |
+--------+
|      2 |
+--------+

DELETE FROM test.ft_innodb LIMIT 1;

SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_FT_DELETED;
+--------+
| DOC_ID |
+--------+
|      2 |
|      3 |
+--------+
```
