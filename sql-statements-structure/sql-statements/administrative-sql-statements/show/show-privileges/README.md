# SHOW PRIVILEGES

## Syntax

```sql
SHOW PRIVILEGES
```

## Description

<code class="highlight fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">SHOW PRIVILEGES</code> shows the list of [system privileges](/sql-statements-structure/sql-statements/account-management-sql-commands/grant/) that the MariaDB server supports. The exact list of privileges depends on the version of your server.

Note that before [MariaDB 10.3.23](/kb/en/mariadb-10323-release-notes/), [MariaDB 10.4.13](/kb/en/mariadb-10413-release-notes/) and [MariaDB 10.5.2](/kb/en/mariadb-1052-release-notes/) , the [Delete history](/kb/en/grant/#table-privileges) privilege displays as `Delete versioning rows` ([MDEV-20382](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20382)).

## Example

From [MariaDB 10.5.9](/kb/en/mariadb-1059-release-notes/)
