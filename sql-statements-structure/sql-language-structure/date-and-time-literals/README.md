# Date and Time Literals

## Standard syntaxes

##### MariaDB starting with [10.0](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-100/)

[MariaDB 10.0](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-100/) supports the SQL standard and ODBC syntaxes for [DATE](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/date), [TIME](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/time) and [TIMESTAMP](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/timestamp) literals.

SQL standard syntax:

- DATE 'string'
- TIME 'string'
- TIMESTAMP 'string'

ODBC syntax:

- {d 'string'}
- {t 'string'}
- {ts 'string'}

The timestamp literals are treated as [DATETIME](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/datetime) literals, because in MariaDB the reange of `DATETIME` is closer to the `TIMESTAMP` range in the SQL standard.

`string` is a string in a proper format, as explained below.

## `DATE` literals

A `DATE` string is a string in one of the following formats: `'YYYY-MM-DD'` or `'YY-MM-DD'`. Note that any punctuation character can be used as delimiter. All delimiters must consist of 1 character. Different delimiters can be used in the same string. Delimiters are optional (but if one delimiter is used, all delimiters must be used).

A `DATE` literal can also be an integer, in one of the following formats: `YYYYMMDD` or `YYMMDD`.

All the following `DATE` literals are valid, and they all represent the same value:

```sql
'19940101'
'940101'
'1994-01-01'
'94/01/01'
'1994-01/01'
'94:01!01'
19940101
940101
```

## `DATETIME` literals

A `DATETIME` string is a string in one of the following formats: `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'` or `'YY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'`. Note that any punctuation character can be used as delimiter for the date part and for the time part. All delimiters must consist of 1 character. Different delimiters can be used in the same string. The hours, minutes and seconds parts can consist of one character. For this reason, delimiters are mandatory for `DATETIME` literals.

The delimiter between the date part and the time part can be a `T` or any sequence of space characters (including tabs, new lines and carriage returns).

A `DATETIME` literal can also be a number, in one of the following formats: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`, `YYMMDDHHMMSS`, `YYYYMMDD` or `YYMMDD`. In this case, all the time subparts must consist of 2 digits.

All the following `DATE` literals are valid, and they all represent the same value:

```sql
'1994-01-01T12:30:03'
'1994/01/01\n\t 12+30+03'
'1994/01\\01\n\t 12+30-03'
'1994-01-01 12:30:3'
```

## `TIME` literals

A `TIME` string is a string in one of the following formats: ` 'D HH:MM:SS'`, `'HH:MM:SS`, `'D HH:MM'`, `'HH:MM'`, `'D HH'`, or `'SS'`. `D` is a value from 0 to 34 which represents days. `:` is the only allowed delimiter for `TIME` literals. Delimiters are mandatory, with an exception: the `'HHMMSS'` format is allowed. When delimiters are used, each part of the literal can consist of one character.

A `TIME` literal can also be a number in one of the following formats: `HHMMSS`, `MMSS`, or `SS`.

The following literals are equivalent:

```sql
'09:05:00'
'9:05:0'
'9:5:0'
'090500'
```

## 2-digits years

The year part in `DATE` and `DATETIME` literals is determined as follows:

- `70` - `99` = `1970` - `1999`
- `00` - `69` = `2000` - `2069`

## Microseconds

`DATETIME` and `TIME` literals can have an optional microseconds part. For both string and numeric forms, it is expressed as a decimal part. Up to 6 decimal digits are allowed. Examples:

```sql
'12:30:00.123456'
123000.123456
```

See [Microseconds in MariaDB](/built-in-functions/date-time-functions/microseconds-in-mariadb) for details.

## Date and time literals and the `SQL_MODE`

Unless the [SQL_MODE](/mariadb-administration/variables-and-modes/sql-mode) `NO_ZERO_DATE` flag is set, some special values are allowed: the `'0000-00-00'` `DATE`, the `'00:00:00'` `TIME`, and the `0000-00-00 00:00:00` `DATETIME`.

If the `ALLOW_INVALID_DATES` flag is set, the invalid dates (for example, 30th February) are allowed. If not, if the `NO_ZERO_DATE` is set, an error is produced; otherwise, a zero-date is returned.

Unless the `NO_ZERO_IN_DATE` flag is set, each subpart of a date or time value (years, hours...) can be set to 0.
