# Geometry Relations

Geometry relations

- [CONTAINS](/sql-statements-structure/geographic-geometric-features/geometry-relations/contains/) — Whether one geometry contains another.
- [CROSSES](/sql-statements-structure/geographic-geometric-features/geometry-relations/crosses/) — Whether two geometries spatially cross
- [DISJOINT](/sql-statements-structure/geographic-geometric-features/geometry-relations/disjoint/) — Whether the two elements do not intersect.
- [EQUALS](/sql-statements-structure/geographic-geometric-features/geometry-relations/equals/) — Indicates whether two geometries are spatially equal.
- [INTERSECTS](/sql-statements-structure/geographic-geometric-features/geometry-relations/intersects/) — Indicates whether two geometries spatially intersect.
- [OVERLAPS](/sql-statements-structure/geographic-geometric-features/geometry-relations/overlaps/) — Indicates whether two elements spatially overlap.
- [ST_CONTAINS](/sql-statements-structure/geographic-geometric-features/geometry-relations/st-contains/) — Whether one geometry is contained by another.
