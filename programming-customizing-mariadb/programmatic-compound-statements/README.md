# Programmatic &amp; Compound Statements

Compound statements in MariaDB can be used both inside and outside (starting from [MariaDB 10.1.1](/kb/en/mariadb-1011-release-notes/)) of [stored programs](/kb/en/stored-programs-and-views/).

- [Using Compound Statements Outside of Stored Programs](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/using-compound-statements-outside-of-stored-programs/) — Compound statements are not just for stored programs.
- [BEGIN END](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/begin-end/) — How to write compound statements.
- [CASE Statement](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/case-statement/) — Conditional construct with multiple choices.
- [DECLARE CONDITION](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/declare-condition/) — For declaring a named error condition (SQLSTATE or error code).
- [DECLARE HANDLER](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/declare-handler/) — Construct to declare how errors are handled.
- [DECLARE Variable](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/declare-variable/) — Declare local variables within stored programs.
- [FOR](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/for/) — FOR loops allow code to be executed a fixed number of times.
- [GOTO](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/goto/) — Jump to the given label.
- [IF](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/if/) — A basic conditional construct statement.
- [ITERATE](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/iterate/) — Used to repeat the execution of the current loop.
- [Labels](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/labels/) — Identifiers used to identify a BEGIN ... END construct.
- [LEAVE](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/leave/) — Used to exit a code block.
- [LOOP](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/loop/) — Used to loop within a code block without a condition.
- [REPEAT LOOP](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/repeat-loop/) — Used to repeat statements until a search condition is true.
- [RESIGNAL](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/resignal/) — Used to send a SIGNAL again for the previous error.
- [RETURN](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/return/) — Statement to terminate execution of a stored function and return a value.
- [SELECT INTO](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/selectinto/) — SQL statement for inserting values into variables.
- [SET Variable](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/set-variable/) — Used to insert a value into a variable with a code block.
- [SIGNAL](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/signal/) — May be used to produce a custom error message.
- [WHILE](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/while/) — Used to repeat a block of SQL statements while a search condition is true.
- [Cursors](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/programmatic-compound-statements-cursors/) — Structure for traversing and processing results, sequentially.
- [Diagnostics](/programming-customizing-mariadb/programmatic-compound-statements/programmatic-compound-statements-diagnostics/) — Error conditions and statement information.
