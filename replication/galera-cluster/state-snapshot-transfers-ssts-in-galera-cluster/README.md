# State Snapshot Transfers (SSTs) in Galera Cluster

- [Introduction to State Snapshot Transfers (SSTs)](/replication/galera-cluster/state-snapshot-transfers-ssts-in-galera-cluster/introduction-to-state-snapshot-transfers-ssts/) — In an SST, the cluster provisions nodes by transferring a full data copy from one node to another.
- [mariabackup SST Method](/replication/galera-cluster/state-snapshot-transfers-ssts-in-galera-cluster/mariabackup-sst-method/) — The mariabackup SST method uses the Mariabackup utility for performing SSTs.
- [Manual SST of Galera Cluster Node With Mariabackup](/replication/galera-cluster/state-snapshot-transfers-ssts-in-galera-cluster/manual-sst-of-galera-cluster-node-with-mariabackup/) — It can be helpful to perform a "manual SST" with Mariabackup when Galera's normal SSTs fail.
- [xtrabackup-v2 SST Method](/replication/galera-cluster/state-snapshot-transfers-ssts-in-galera-cluster/xtrabackup-v2-sst-method/) — The xtrabackup-v2 SST method uses the Percona XtraBackup utility for performing SSTs.
- [Manual SST of Galera Cluster Node With Percona XtraBackup](/replication/galera-cluster/state-snapshot-transfers-ssts-in-galera-cluster/manual-sst-of-galera-cluster-node-with-percona-xtrabackup/) — It can be helpful to perform a "manual SST" with Xtrabackup when Galera's normal SSTs fail.
