<strong>Release date:</strong> 4 Sep 2012

[MariaDB Galera 5.5.25](/kb/en/mariadb-galera-cluster-5525-release-notes/) is an <strong><em>[Alpha](/kb/en/release-criteria/)</em></strong> release. It is a
merge of [MariaDB 5.5.25](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-55/) and Galera Cluster with some
limited additional bug fixes. This is the first MariaDB Galera release, and we
are releasing it now to get it into the hands of any who might want to test it.
<strong>Do not use alpha releases on production systems.</strong>

Various articles about MariaDB Galera Cluster, including [known limitations](/replication/galera-cluster/mariadb-galera-cluster-known-limitations) and [how to get started](/replication/galera-cluster/getting-started-with-mariadb-galera-cluster) are available in the <strong>[Galera](/kb/en/galera/)</strong> section of the Knowledgebase.

For a list of changes made in [MariaDB Galera 5.5.25](/kb/en/mariadb-galera-cluster-5525-release-notes/), with links to detailed

[MariaDB Galera 5.5.25 Changelog](/replication/galera-cluster/mariadb-galera-cluster-releases/mariadb-galera-55-changelogs/mariadb-galera-5525-changelog).

In most respects [MariaDB](/replication/optimization-and-tuning/query-optimizations/guiduuid-performance/mariadb) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.
