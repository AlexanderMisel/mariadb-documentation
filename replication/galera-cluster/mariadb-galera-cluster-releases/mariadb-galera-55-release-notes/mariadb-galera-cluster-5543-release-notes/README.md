### Deprecated Distributions

As per the [MariaDB Deprecation Policy](/kb/en/mariadb-deprecation-policy/), this will
be the final release of MariaDB Galera Cluster 5.5 for Fedora 19 "Schr√∂dinger's Cat", Ubuntu
10.04 LTS "Lucid", and Mint 9 LTS "Isadora". When the next
version of MariaDB Galera Cluster 5.5 is released, repositories for these distributions will
go away.

## Notes

- Running MariaDB Galera Cluster 5.5 and 10.0 nodes in a cluster is not
  supported ([MDEV-6257](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-6257))

- This version of MariaDB Galera Cluster supports `wsrep` API v25 which means
  MariaDB Galera Cluster can be used with either a 25.2.x or 25.3.x
  Galera `wsrep` provider. A 25.3.x `wsrep` provider is included in the
  MariaDB repositories and is also available from the
  [downloads](http://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb-galera/5.5.43) page.

- See the [MariaDB 5.5.43 Release Notes](/kb/en/mariadb-5543-release-notes/) and
[Changelog](/kb/en/mariadb-5543-changelog/) for more information on the changes in
MariaDB.

Note: If Galera 25.2.x and 25.3.x are both being used in the cluster, MariaDB
with Galera 25.3.x must be started with
[wsrep_provider_options='socket.checksum=1'](/kb/en/wsrep_provider_options/#socketchecksum) in order to make it backward
compatible with Galera v2. Galera wsrep providers other than 25.3.x or 25.2.x
are not supported.

Thanks, and enjoy MariaDB Galera Cluster!
