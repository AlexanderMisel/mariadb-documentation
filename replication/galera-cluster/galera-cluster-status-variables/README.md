# Galera Cluster Status Variables

## Viewing Galera Cluster Status variables

Galera Status variables can be viewed with the [SHOW STATUS](/sql-statements-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-status) statement.

```sql
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep%';
```

- <strong>Description:</strong> Current length of the receive queue, which is the number of writesets waiting to be applied.

---

#### `wsrep_local_recv_queue_avg`

- <strong>Description:</strong> Average length of the receive queue since the most recent status query. If this value is noticeably larger than zero, the node is likely to be overloaded, and cannot apply the writesets as quickly as they arrive, resulting in replication throttling.
