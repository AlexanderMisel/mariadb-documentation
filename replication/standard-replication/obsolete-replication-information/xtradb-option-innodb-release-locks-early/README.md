# XtraDB option --innodb-release-locks-early

The --innodb-release-locks-early feature ([MWL#163](http://askmonty.org/worklog/?tid=163)) was included in the [5.2
replication preview](/replication/standard-replication/obsolete-replication-information/mariadb-52-replication-feature-preview/). However, it was omitted from [MariaDB 5.3](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-53/) due to the bug
[lp:798213](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maria/+bug/798213).
