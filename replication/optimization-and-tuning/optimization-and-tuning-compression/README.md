# Compression

There are a number of different kinds of compression in MariaDB

- [Encryption, Hashing and Compression Functions](/built-in-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/) — Functions used for encryption, hashing and compression.
- [ColumnStore Compression Mode](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/mariadb-columnstore/columnstore-sql-structure-and-commands/columnstore-compression-mode/) — ColumnStore has the ability to compress data
- [Compressing Events to Reduce Size of the Binary Log](/replication/standard-replication/compressing-events-to-reduce-size-of-the-binary-log/) — Binlog events can be compressed to save space on disk and in network transfers
- [InnoDB Page Compression](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-page-compression/) — InnoDB page compression, which is more sophisticated than the COMPRESSED row format.
- [InnoDB Row Formats Overview](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-row-formats/innodb-row-formats-overview/) — InnoDB's row formats are REDUNDANT, COMPACT, DYNAMIC, and COMPRESSED.
- [Storage-Engine Independent Column Compression](/replication/optimization-and-tuning/optimization-and-tuning-compression/storage-engine-independent-column-compression/) — Storage-engine independent support for column compression.
