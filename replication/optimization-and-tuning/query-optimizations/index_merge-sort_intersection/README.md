# index_merge sort_intersection

Prior to [MariaDB 5.3](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-53/), the `index_merge` access method supported `union`,
`sort-union`, and `intersection` operations. Starting from [MariaDB 5.3](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-53/), the
`sort-intersection` operation is also supported. This allows the use of
`index_merge` in a broader number of cases.

This feature is disabled by default. To enable it, turn on the optimizer switch
`index_merge_sort_intersection` like so:

```sql
SET optimizer_switch='index_merge_sort_intersection=on'
```

## Limitations of index_merge/intersection

Prior to [MariaDB 5.3](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-53/), the `index_merge` access method had one intersection
strategy called `intersection`. That strategy can only be used when merged
index scans produced rowid-ordered streams. In practice this means that an
`intersection` could only be constructed from equality (=) conditions.

For example, the following query will use `intersection`:

```sql
MySQL [ontime]> EXPLAIN SELECT AVG(arrdelay) FROM ontime WHERE depdel15=1 AND OriginState ='CA';
+--+-----------+------+-----------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+----+-----+-------------------------------------------------+
|id|select_type|table |type       |possible_keys       |key                 |key_len|ref |rows |Extra                                            |
+--+-----------+------+-----------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+----+-----+-------------------------------------------------+
| 1|SIMPLE     |ontime|index_merge|OriginState,DepDel15|OriginState,DepDel15|3,5    |NULL|76952|Using intersect(OriginState,DepDel15);Using where|
+--+-----------+------+-----------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+----+-----+-------------------------------------------------+
```

but if you replace `OriginState ='CA'`  with  `OriginState IN ('CA', 'GB')`
(which matches the same number of records), then `intersection` is not usable
anymore:

```sql
MySQL [ontime]> explain select avg(arrdelay) from ontime where depdel15=1 and OriginState IN ('CA', 'GB');
+--+-----------+------+----+--------------------+--------+-------+-----+-----+-----------+
|id|select_type|table |type|possible_keys       |key     |key_len|ref  |rows |Extra      |
+--+-----------+------+----+--------------------+--------+-------+-----+-----+-----------+
| 1|SIMPLE     |ontime|ref |OriginState,DepDel15|DepDel15|5      |const|36926|Using where|
+--+-----------+------+----+--------------------+--------+-------+-----+-----+-----------+
```

The latter query would also run 5.x times slower (from 2.2 to 10.8 seconds) in
our experiments.

## How index_merge/sort_intersection improves the situation

In [MariaDB 5.3](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-53/), when `index_merge_sort_intersection` is enabled,
`index_merge` intersection plans can be constructed from non-equality
conditions:

```sql
MySQL [ontime]> explain select avg(arrdelay) from ontime where depdel15=1 and OriginState IN ('CA', 'GB');
+--+-----------+------+-----------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+----+-----+--------------------------------------------------------+
|id|select_type|table |type       |possible_keys       |key                 |key_len|ref |rows |Extra                                                   |
+--+-----------+------+-----------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+----+-----+--------------------------------------------------------+
| 1|SIMPLE     |ontime|index_merge|OriginState,DepDel15|DepDel15,OriginState|5,3    |NULL|60754|Using sort_intersect(DepDel15,OriginState); Using where |
+--+-----------+------+-----------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+----+-----+--------------------------------------------------------+
```

In our tests, this query ran in 3.2 seconds, which is not as good as the case
with two equalities, but still much better than 10.8 seconds we were getting
without `sort_intersect`.

The `sort_intersect` strategy has higher overhead than `intersect` but is
able to handle a broader set of `WHERE` conditions.

## When to use

`index_merge/sort_intersection` works best on tables with lots of records and
where intersections are sufficiently large (but still small enough to make a
full table scan overkill).

The benefit is expected to be bigger for io-bound loads.
