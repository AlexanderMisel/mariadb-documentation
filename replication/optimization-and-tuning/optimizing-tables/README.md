# Optimizing Tables

Different ways to optimize tables and data on disk

- [OPTIMIZE TABLE](/replication/optimization-and-tuning/optimizing-tables/optimize-table/) — Reclaim unused space and defragment data.
- [ANALYZE TABLE](/sql-statements-structure/sql-statements/table-statements/analyze-table/) — Store key distributions for a table.
- [Choosing the Right Storage Engine](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/choosing-the-right-storage-engine/) — Quickly choose the most suitable storage engine for your needs.
- [Converting Tables from MyISAM to InnoDB](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/converting-tables-from-myisam-to-innodb/) — Issues when converting tables from MyISAM to InnoDB.
- [Histogram-Based Statistics](/replication/optimization-and-tuning/query-optimizations/statistics-for-optimizing-queries/histogram-based-statistics/) — Histogram-based statistics can improve the optimizer query plan in certain situations.
- [Defragmenting InnoDB Tablespaces](/replication/optimization-and-tuning/optimizing-tables/defragmenting-innodb-tablespaces/) — MariaDB 10.1.1 introduced a feature to defragment InnoDB tablespaces.
- [Entity-Attribute-Value Implementation](/replication/optimization-and-tuning/optimizing-tables/entity-attribute-value-implementation/) — A common, poorly performing, design pattern (EAV); plus an alternative
- [IP Range Table Performance](/replication/optimization-and-tuning/optimizing-tables/ip-range-table-performance/) — IP Range Table Performance Improvements
